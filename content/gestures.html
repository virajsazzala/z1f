            Hellewww cutie... so, this is the last part of the website, this website is just like one of the small things I do for you, a small gesture that might make you happy, put a smile on your face... exactly like our small moments <br>
            Moments like when you hold the end of my sleeve, and I hold yours hehe <br>
            Moments like when we give each other the smallest things, which appear so normal but hold so much significance and means the world to us… <br> 
            For every moment when you wait for, to the time when you wait for me outside my class, in the morning at the parking, near the red wagonR... all these has all of my heart love <br>
            No matter how many times I get late and how much I gate late by... you always find reasons to forgive me... I love you so much &#9829<br>
            I steal all your scrunchies, your hair clips, and hair ties out of which will always stay on my right wrist, … I love because … you have stolen my heart love... I deserve these...  ;)<br>
            Moments like when we getting straws of matching colours, I swear that has a special place in my heart<br>
            Moments like when you make sure to get me a tissue because I’m a spilly eater, thank you so much for taking care of me<br>
            Moments when you try and make my messy hair look humane… thank you for doing this because I have already given up on my hair<br>
            Moments when you get me sandwiches from your home because somehow you already know every time on your own that I’m hungry, I love you so much for that <br>
            Moments when you force me to take care of myself, tell me to drive safe, tell me to moisturize my face (I still don’t understand how you find out that I didn’t moisturized)<br> 
            This website love is exactly like one of those small moments...<br>
            Throughout this website you might’ve thought about why I made this website.. well love, I love giving you gifts, any kind of surprise that might make you smile<br>
            I love giving you gifts, flowers books and now this will also be one them… and the best part about this one is you can come and visit this website anytime but most importantly, you can visit this website during times when you feel like distant, anxious, or have any other thoughts … know that I will always be with you, I’ll always be beside you, and<br> you'll never walk alone my love...<br>
