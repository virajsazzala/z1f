            11th February, 2022, Friday, just a few minutes into the last hour of college on a sunny afternoon … and life changed for the best <br>
            Like the happiness after seeing an unexpected rainbow<br>
            So unexpected that I never got the chance to thank the wind that took me to that PPS class <br>
            Like the calmness at the peak of the hill<br>
            Like the stillness in the middle of the forest<br>
            Everything took a turn, a slow turn, an expressive one though<br>
            A turn that was worth of moving every bit of it… <br>
            I was someone who was shivering with the fear of the world<br>
            And you came in like the warmest quilt with a snuggle of calmness<br>
            Every time I look back to us in the talking phase, I find a million reasons to hit my head and be not so dumb.. <br>
            But those smallest things.. you explaining me the smallest of the smallest things because I had no clue of the real world.. and never ever getting tired of it<br>
            I’m really sorry for I don’t know how many signs and hints I missed, but I am beyond grateful for you never leaving my side .. you are the best part of my life Khushi.. and to be precise now.. you are my life <br>
            To the smallest dates, to the most simple ones, the old school, maybe we are like that but we are for each other. <br>
            From the first spilly McDonald burger date, to me wiping my face on your sleeve today <br>
            From hiding my teeth with every smile to smiling uncontrollably everytime I think about you <br>
            From being insecure about myself to running to you whenever anything happens, you’re my safe space<br>
            From having the fear of being judged, to saying the stupidest shit without even thinking once <br>
            From all black to different colours I don’t even know the names of because of my colour defect.. thank you for making my life colourful baby<br>
            From hating myself to be alive to feeling the worth to live every bit of my life with you<br>
            You are the best thing that has ever happened to me Khushi, you have made me a better person, in and out I have become better and I will become even better for you, for me, for us, anything and everything it takes.. because you are worth living for my love, and I have found my reason to keep going and keep loving which is you, and I will continue to do more my love. <br> 
            Khushi, my love I know we have come far, but its still a long way for us to go, there will be many more arguments, many more sad nights, many more forgiving moments, many more toughest of the toughest nights, but I’ll go through it all because you’re worth it all my love, because that smile of yours, I could go against the world for it<br>
            This love that I have for you, it grows.. more and more every day, I love you more than yesterday and less than tomorrow, every new day is a blessing to me because I know I am going to live one more day with you and for you. <br>
            I LOVE YOU SO MUCH KHUSHI<br>
            I REALLY DO <3
