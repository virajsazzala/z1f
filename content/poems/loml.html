                its her smile on a dark stormy<br>
                light of my life (loml)<br>
                its her smile on a dark stormy day<br>
                erasing the pouring clouds off my face<br>
                its her touch that calms me down<br>
                her hand, that caresses through my heart<br>
                her shoulder, where i feel home and..<br>
                her words accompanying my unattended thoughts<br>
                we'd smile at each other randomly and..<br>
                wonder how can someone be so freaking lovely<br>
                I'd hold her sleeve and feel protected<br>
                her cuteness melting me down..<br>
                making my day complete..<br>
                i slept and she started adoring my existence<br>
                while my dreams spoke to the stars about her<br>
                she looks like the rest of my life..<br>
                she's the sweetest candy that the lucky kid got,<br>
                and I'm the lucky kid... ; ) ...<br>
                we'd vibe together and the whole world would just... disappear..<br>
                I'd really love to be hers for every breath i breathe <3 <br>
