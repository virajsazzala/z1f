            <p class="poem">
                I walk past a million strangers<br>
                Strangers with familiar faces<br>
                Faces you swear you have seen in your dreams<br>
                But strolling past<br>
                Hoping to meet someone<br>
                I am met with disappointment<br>
                The crowd makes me lonely<br>
                The people around highlight the void <br>
                A place where one might think nothing exists<br>
                But to me, a void is a place where I live<br>
                Wondering if this emptiness adds upto something<br>
                I realise my life is empty<br>
                Like a game of chess without the king<br>
                A spring without flowers blooming<br>
                A childhood without friendships<br>
                A one sided love<br>
                This nothingness urges me to find that missing bit <br>
                But I wonder <br>
                Can anything go missing in an empty place?<br>
                People tell me time will eventually fill that void<br>
                But I ask, is time really the apt measure <br>
                Can time really indicate when this emptiness will disappear<br>
                With time, will I feel less lonely or will I just get accustomed to being the only one?<br>
                With time, will all my sufferings end or will I just become numb to all this pain?<br>
                With time, will I find my missing piece or will I just lose it all?<br>
                Pondering over these questions<br>
                A realization strikes<br>
                The life I had been leading just involved me<br>
                The boundaries restricted movements<br>
                The space confined me<br>
                Was I suffocating all this while?<br>
                I want to break free, I decide<br>
                I see a hand reaching out<br>
                I am hesitant and unsure,<br>
                but I still take it<br>
                Its you<br>
                Walking towards me like the fresh breath of air<br>
                Creating a safe place for me,for us<br>
                Providing me with freedom<br>
                Making me think my life involves me and you<br>
                I proceed to walk into a crowded place<br>
                I see your familiar face<br>
                Smiling at me<br>
                A realization strikes<br>
                I was hoping to meet someone<br>
                And I met my missing piece<br>
                You greet me with your smile,<br>
                Which is warmer than the sun shining bright above us<br>
                You ask me about my day<br>
                Together,we walk<br>
                Into a crowded place<br>
                Unfamiliar faces go unnoticed<br>
                Our hands held, our conversation going<br>
                Weâ€™ve slipped into a void<br>
                a place where everything ceases to exist<br>
                except us<br>
                the void has everything we need<br>
                you, me and our playlist<br>
                this void begins to fill<br>
                and it evolves<br>
                it becomes our bubble<br>
                a new place for us<br>
                where only <br>
                you and I,<br>
                live,<br>
                happily,<br>
                together.<br>
