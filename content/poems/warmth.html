                Knew it all, the moment I spoke to you.<br>
                this subtle aura of calmness around you,<br>
                lost all the time, wherever it went...<br>
                my erupting thoughts slept for a while.<br>
                after all, if its you at the other end,<br>
                its all worth it...<br>
                now all I’d wish for is you to stay...<br>
                take my hand, let’s talk about it all.<br>
                these unforeseen novel happy moments, <br>
                can i cherish this this with you...<br>
                hate for it to fade away.<br>
                so grasp this heart, its for you,<br>
                feel the warmth of this bubble,<br>
                its finally customised for you.<br>
                i know it took me time, glad you stayed for it...<br>
                trust me, you won’t regret for what its worth.<br>
