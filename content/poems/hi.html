                HI!<br>
    
                Shoulder beside me<br>
                His Brown eyes<br>
                Soaking in the sunlight<br>
                He’s crafted  in a different sense<br>
                He says “it’s a new OS”<br>
                Pushes his hair backwards<br>
                And my eyes fixated on him<br>
                I’d say he’s a walking ray of sunshine<br>
                His presence completes me<br>
                He laughs about the silliest things<br>
                Says his humor is broken<br>
                Talks nerdy <br>
                With so much passion<br>
                That I am all ears <br>
                He finds his escape in a court<br>
                Monster and munch are his materialistic  buddies<br>
    
                Walks me to my classrooms<br>
                And often trips me<br>
                His laugh is pure,<br>
                His existence is a bliss<br>
    
                His words melt me<br>
                Assure me, Validate me<br>
                Our dynamics are crazy<br>
                He distracts me so often<br>
    
                Never thought I’d cross paths <br>
                With you, my love<br>
                But look at us now<br>
                Sitting under our Sakura <br>
                Sipping watermelon juice<br>
                Bullying each other<br>
                Our fingers touching every so often<br>
                Talking about things that only makes sense to us<br>
    
                I find myself coming back to this moment<br>
                Holding it very close to my heart<br>
                Being grateful of having met you<br>
                For I, thank you, like the moon would thank the stars for providing it company in an endless,lonely and dark sky<br>
                For you, my love, are the star in my sky<br>
                Twinkling so bright<br>
                Filling this dull sky with light<br>
                With hope<br>
                And with,love!<br>
                <3
