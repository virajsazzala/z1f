                the way she looks at me<br>
                and the way she smiles<br>
                the way she sighs<br>
                and the way she bursts out laughing suddenly<br>
                and the way she puts her stangstrang of hair behind her ears<br>
                the way she tries to be mad but looks cuter<br>
                and the way she tries to be tough bully<br>
                the way she laughs at dumb things<br>
                and the way she puts in efforts even for the little things<br>
                the way she caresses and calms me down<br>
                and the way she makes me feel protected<br>
                but...<br>
                the way she tries to hide herself <br>
                and the way she thinks she's not enough<br>
                the way she hid her tears and no one knew about it<br>
                and the way she carries herself through<br>
                the way she handles the million thoughts up her head<br>
                and the way she thinks she'll be okay<br>
                the way she walks even when she's exhausted<br>
                and the way she looks at things even when she wants to close her eyes<br>
                although not sure if she knows...<br>
                there's someone who'll always believe in her<br>
                there's someone who wants to hold her hand and let her knows that its okay<br>
                there's someone who wants to lend her a shoulder to cry <br>
                there's someone who's assured about her in all ways<br>
                there's someone who loves her the way nobody tried to<br>
                there's someone who never wants her to walk alone<br>
                there's someone who just wants to make her happy<br>
                there's someone who'll be there for her during the raibows and the rain.<br>
