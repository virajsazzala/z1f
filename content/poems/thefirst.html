                Car rides act as our escape<br>
                You and I<br>
                Vibing to your playlist<br>
                We find it each other looking<br>
                A little less on the road<br>
                But a little more at each other<br>
                Our fingers interlocked<br>
                We sing each other praises<br>
                Our silence is overshadowed by our sneaky stares<br>
                Time rushes in this space<br>
                8 hours feel like 8 seconds<br>
                Despite this, we maintain our pace<br>
                But that wasn’t something I reckoned<br>
                I realize I never want to leave this space<br>
                A space which we call ours<br>
                I can drown in his eyes for hours<br>
                Blood rushing in my veins like it’s a race<br>
                So overwhelmed by his attention<br>
                Tears roll out my eyes<br>
                For I feel appreciated<br>
                And felt home<br>
                In his arms<br>
                Wrapped around my skin<br>
                The friction between our bodies <br>
                Emitting heat waves<br>
                Making the air less cool as the time goes on<br>
                his hands tracing every outline of my body<br>
                my skin feels like an empty canvas <br>
                splashed with paint<br>
                a paint that sparks love and care<br>
                a color so bright, <br>
                that you’d forget the association of white with purity.<br>
                our eyes closed, <br>
                we find each other by the finger tips<br>
                we explore pieces of each other<br>
                that were never discovered<br>
                Serotonin induced in our body <br>
                My mind in haze<br>
                Can’t make sense of my thoughts<br>
                I let my hands dominate <br>
                We move in unison<br>
                Our movements coordinated like a dance rehearsal<br>
                The music in the background starts diminishing<br>
                The view becomes blurry<br>
                I start losing my sense of feeling<br>
                I let his love consume me<br>
                This leaves me weak<br>
                Breathless<br>
                In pain<br>
                But I find myself wanting for more<br>
                More of this<br>
                More of him<br>
                There’s no end to desiring him<br>
                There’s no dead end in our road of love<br>
                It’s a path we built<br>
                Firm but unwavering steps led us into finding each other<br>
                The universe conspiring for us to cross paths<br>
                Two broken and damaged people<br>
                Meant to meet<br>
                Meant to heal<br>
                Meant to love<br>
                Meant to experience what it felt being in love and being loved.<br>
                Meant to have a someone<br>
                Someone who’d lend you a shoulder<br>
                Someone who’d squeeze you into their arms<br>
                Someone who’d celebrate your tiny victories<br>
                Someone who’d help you overcome your difficulties<br>
                Someone who’d love you at your worst<br>
                But someone who’d make you feel better on your good days<br>
                 Having that someone in your life feels like hitting a jackpot you never bought tickets for<br>
                But now, I treasure and cherish this <br>
                I have overused my luck<br>
                I am outta luck now<br>
                But I was lucky enough to meet you<br>
                And even luckier to meet this version of myself<br>
                Who ceased to exist?<br>
                But you brought her to life<br>
                It felt like you took years out of your immortal life<br>
                And lent it to this poor heart of mine<br>
                The soul that kept looking for time .<br>
